> People have multiple accounts and passwords.Some of these accounts include:
> 1. facebook
> 2. Twitter
> 3. Gmail
> 4. Slack 
> 5.Instagram

> The problem that arises is that people tend to forget some passwords of different accounts

### __How the application works__
1. First of all the user has to be able to run the application using \*_python3.6 run.py_\* but if the user has run the following command \*chmod +x functionality.py\* on the terminal he can run the application by typing *./run.py*

2.

3. Once a user is logged a menu will pop-up requesting the user to enter the following codes:
  > **_c:_** creates an account and the password for the account
      * *note*. If you create an account you will be prompted to to enter a secret_key:

            > ***_note: always remeber your secret key since it will be used to search for your saved account credential_***
  > **_look:_** search for your account credential
      * *note* you will be asked to enter the accountname of your so as to be able to search for your saved account credentials
  > **_see:_** displays your saved credentials account and its password
